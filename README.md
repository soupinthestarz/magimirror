# Magic Mirror Website :)
by Ava Chong  
This Magic Mirror uses a free weather api from weatherapi.com to get weather in Farenheit and condition of weather based off user's location.  
It also pulls from a .json data file with my favorite lyrics to display at a set interval of changing every 15 seconds, though there is an added feature of a button to cycle faster through lyrics.  
MagiMirror use's user's camera to project video back, imitating a "mirror".  
It's perfect as a fun piece to take photos in, or use to check weather and time in a cutesy way!  
It tracks time by the second, and displays in the 12 hr time format with HH:MM:SS.  

**Will be added to my personal portfolio website when it is finished, but if running on your machine, set up a local server on your machine to run, otherwise, the lyrics from .json file will not load due to it not being a https or similar request, and it is deemed unsecure due to being from "two different sources".
